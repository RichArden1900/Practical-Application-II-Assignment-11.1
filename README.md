Project machine learning to answer "what drives the car price ?"

Visualization

On the graph above we can see that the numerical variable that has significant value to the car price is the cylinders rather than the odometer or year
That means if the car has 6 or 4 cylinders will adjusting the price rather the year that the car made

On the category variable the category of drive 4wd, drive rwd, size full-size, fuel diesel, fuel electric has significant value to the price variable rather than any category variable

From above we know that the test and training error dataset has many to adjust so we need to adjust the model again to get the better MSE and R^2 using the feature engineering method
